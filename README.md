This project is a Blazor Server application designed for managing a patient database with genetic disorders.
Its main goals are:

Data management: storing and organizing information about patients with various genetic abnormalities.

Phenotype correlation: identifying and analyzing connections between genetic disorders and patient phenotypes.

Clinical insights: providing users with access to the results of clinical reviews and summaries related to specific pathologies.

The application aims to serve as a practical tool for researchers and clinicians, offering a clear and structured way to explore genetic data and its clinical implications.
